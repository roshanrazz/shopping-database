# Stored Procedure vs User defined function

## Stored Procedure
- Stored procedure can return zero, single, or multiple values.
- We can use transactions in stored procedure.
- Stored procedure can have input/output (IN/OUT/INOUT) parameter.
- We can call function from stored procedure.


## User defined function
- Function must return a value.
- We can't use transactions in functions.
- Functions have only input parameter.
- We can't call stored procedure from function.
